## About the Video Course
	
A short, early to market exploration of the changes to ASP.NET MVC 6. This video course delivers a fast track tour of the fundamental changes made between the previous iteration of MVC and the new version. This includes how all of the major frameworks (web API, forms, MVC) have been rolled under the umbrella of a single unified programming model, how developers can now interact with Github following the move away from Codeplex, the introduction of .NET core as a centralised runtime, coverage of dependency changes, and anything that has had a major impact on development. The course structure will be framed via illustrative comparisons between the previous version and MVC 6, demonstrating key development implementations side by side. Tone and narrative is a key element with this video course, and should be conveyed strongly by the author, and the marketing copy and product page. We want to convey what is a strong value proposition right now: that this video course delivers the absolute essentials for transitioning developers, that we identify the pain of ASP.NET developers working with a beta version that is currently still experiencing bugs and breakages, and that we are guiding them through this transition with the he lp of an expert developer possessing over 10 years experience.
